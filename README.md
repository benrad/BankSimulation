# BankSimulation

This is my solution for the final project of an advanced C# course I took at UCSD. The goal was to create a 
simulation of a bank in which multiple customers and tellers can make concurrent deposits and withdrawals. Queues, 
locking, and cancellation tokens are used to ensure that concurrency is handled properly and that multiple threads of 
execution do not result in corrupt data. The project received an "A" and is posted with the permission of the 
instructor.
